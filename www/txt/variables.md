#### The independent variables:

Survival on the Titanic is a binary outcome, and on the left side, you can see how many people survived, shown through a series of simple bar plots. But if we want to explore the effect of several independent variables at the same time, a Sankey plot is the way to go. It lets you visually follow how these variables work together. You can literally see how many people in each group survived (1) or did not survive (0).

What do you think? Which variable has the strongest effect on survival? It looks like sex and class have a big impact. Instead of guessing, we can use logistic regression to estimate the effect of passengers' sex, age, and class simultaneously.
