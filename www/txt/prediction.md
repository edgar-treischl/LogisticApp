#### Make a prediction by providing values:

This is probably the most intuitive way to understand logistic regression â€” because what we really want to know is the **probability to survive**, not log odds or odds ratios.

Using the model, we can predict survival probabilities! For example, watch how the predicted chance to survive changes when you switch from female to male. Below, you can also adjust age and passenger class to see how those factors influence the probability of survival.
